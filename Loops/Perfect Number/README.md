## Project Details: 
This program checks whether a given number is a perfect number or not. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding the number itself).

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Compile the Java file using the command: javac PerfectNumber.java
3. Run the compiled program using the command: java PerfectNumber
4. Enter a number when prompted.
5. The program will determine whether the entered number is a perfect number or not and display the result on the console.  

Please note that the program expects the input number to be a positive integer. If a non-integer or a negative number is entered, the program may produce unexpected results.

Feel free to explore and modify the program according to your needs.
