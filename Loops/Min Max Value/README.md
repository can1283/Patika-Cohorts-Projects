## Project Details:
This Java program finds the largest and smallest numbers among N numbers entered from the keyboard and prints them on the screen. The user is first prompted to enter the number of values they want to input, and then the program determines the largest and smallest numbers among the entered values. The program uses a simple loop to iterate through the user's input numbers and updates the variables for the largest and smallest numbers.
## How to use:
1. Run the program.
2. In the console screen, you will be prompted to enter the number of values you want to input.
3. Enter the number of values and press Enter.
4. Then, enter the numbers one by one and press Enter after each input.
5. The program will determine the largest and smallest numbers among the entered values and print the results on the console screen.
### Example usage:
```
How many numbers will you enter: 4
Enter number 1: 16
Enter number 2: -22
Enter number 3: -15
Enter number 4: 100
Maximum number: 100
Minimum number: -22
```
In this output, the maximum number is 100, and the minimum number is -22, as determined from the input values.
