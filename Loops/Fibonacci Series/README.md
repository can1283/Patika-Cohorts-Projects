## Project Details:
In this program, we take the number of elements in the Fibonacci series as input from the user. Then, we define the first two numbers (0 and 1). We print these initial numbers and then use a loop to calculate and print the remaining numbers in the Fibonacci series. We update the previous two numbers in each iteration to continue the series.
