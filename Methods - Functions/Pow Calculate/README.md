## Project Details:
This Java program calculates the power of a number using a recursive method. The base and exponent values are taken from the user as input.

The power method recursively calculates the power by multiplying the base with itself (exponent - 1) times if the exponent is positive, or by dividing 1 by the base multiplied with itself (absolute value of exponent - 1) times if the exponent is negative. If the exponent is 0, the method returns 1.

In the main method, the user is prompted to enter the base and exponent values. The power method is then called with these values, and the result is stored in the result variable. Finally, the result is printed to the console.

Please note that this program assumes integer values for the base and exponent.
