## Project Details:
In this program, we use the Scanner class to prompt the user to enter a year. Then, we use an if-else statement to check whether the entered year is a leap year or not.  
The condition ```year % 4 == 0``` checks if the entered year is divisible by 4. The condition ```(year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0)``` checks if the year is not divisible by 100 or if it is divisible by 400.
