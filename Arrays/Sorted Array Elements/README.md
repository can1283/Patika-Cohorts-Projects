## Project Details:

This is a Java program that prompts the user to enter the length of an array and then allows them to input elements for that array. After receiving the input, the program sorts the array in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method and finally prints the sorted array.

The program first asks the user to enter the length of the array. If the entered value is not a positive integer, it displays an error message and exits the program.

Then, it creates an array of the specified length and uses a loop to get input from the user for each element of the array.

After receiving all the elements, the program uses the `Arrays.sort()` method to sort the array in ascending order.

Finally, it prints the sorted array by iterating over each element of the array and displaying it on the console.

Please let me know if you need further assistance or have any specific questions.
