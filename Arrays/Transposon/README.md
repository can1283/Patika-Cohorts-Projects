## Projet Details:  
The program uses a predefined matrix to calculate its transpose and prints the result. Firstly, we determine the number of rows and columns in the input matrix. Then, we create a matrix of the appropriate size to store the transpose.

Using nested loops, the program iterates over the elements of the input matrix and assigns them to the corresponding positions in the transpose matrix. The outer loop represents the rows, while the inner loop represents the columns. By changing the indices of the nested loops according to the loop conditions, the transpose operation is performed.

Finally, the `printMatrix` method is used to print both the input matrix and the transpose matrix. This method iterates over the matrix and prints each element in an orderly manner, considering the rows and columns.
